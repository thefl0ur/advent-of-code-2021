# Advent of code 2021

This is my first attempt to solve advent of code puzzles.

In main branch placed refactored solution, which I done later.
Original messy solutions can be found in branch `original_solutions`.

### Stats
I was limited by my time and knowledge in time I discovered AoC, so
not all puzzles was cleared.
