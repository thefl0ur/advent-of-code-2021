This puzzle is graph-based, and have zero experience of working with them. Not touch it even in university.
I remember what most part of code I get from internet.

|   DAY |   MEM 1, Kb | TIME 1         |   MEM 2, Kb | TIME 2         |
|-------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
|    12 |     649.409 | 0:00:00.037005 |     19065.1 | 0:00:18.685921 |

Part 2 is ridiculous slow, so I guess I have to understand graphs and move even from brute force solution.
