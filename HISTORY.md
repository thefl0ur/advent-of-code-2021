Solve part 2 of day 5. I was so close to solve back in days. I actually pretty tired of this puzzles, so I do nothing to properly optimize code.

30.04.2022

Finally solve part 2 of Day 4 puzzle. Pretty tired of all this and almost do noting to optimize my code. May by do it later?

Added `create` command for cli. Command creates folder structure and base file for provided day.

26.04.2022

Refactor day 3 puzzles.

22.04.2022

Go back to day 1 and improve it even more

21.04.2022

Tests added.
Duiring the optimization I have to check that refactored solution actually give correct result,
so instead of manual work I prefer to semi-automate that process.

20.04.2022

Improve my solution for day 2.

19.04.2022

Improve my solution for day 1. I thought it was good, but ot was not. Also, add some notes about process of optimizatoin. 

18.04.2022

Before jumping into optimization or my solutions and solving remained puzzles cli was created.
I'm not great with making sweet and pretty cli, so for now it is strange and ugly. I hope it can be improved later.

Repo created.
Solutions for first 2 days added as is. Looks like I lost my original code
because I remember how I refactor day 1 solution after discovering sliding
window approach in [this article](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/12/advent-of-code-2021-in-kotlin-day-1/).

By time of beginning I already know the fact you have to write expandable solutions 
because part 2 _probably_ will use some of part 1 functionality. 
Later, with mode and mode hard tasks, I give up with it. But first attempts was created with almost
production-ready standards: typing, classes and clear login.
