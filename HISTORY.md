Finally find courage to properly solve day 12 puzzle.

07.05.2022

Was trying to optimize day 11 solution, but finish without any real improvements. 

05.05.2022

Refactor and optimize day 10 puzzles.

04.05.2022

Day 9 added. Thanks to [this article](https://10xlearner.com/2022/02/28/advent-of-code-2021-smoke-basin-puzzle-9/) for opening my eyes on existing algorithms.

03.05.2022

Solve part 2 for day 8.

What I do with my live? Why I spend half of weekend thing to connect wires in 7-segment display?

Some ideas of algorithm I find in [this post](https://medium.com/xorum-io/ideas-and-solutions-for-advent-of-code-2021-in-kotlin-part-2-4-5079d5066653) and various threads on reddit. 

02.05.2022

Solve part 2 for day 7.

That puzzle relates to math, which I don't know well. I program algorithm I head about, rather than write my owm. 

01.05.2022

Solve part 2 of day 5. I was so close to solve back in days. I'm still tired so I do nothing to properly optimize code.

Also added day 6 solution, fortunately it is so good, I don't know how to make it better.


30.04.2022

Finally solve part 2 of Day 4 puzzle. Pretty tired of all this and almost do noting to optimize my code. May by do it later?

Added `create` command for cli. Command creates folder structure and base file for provided day.

26.04.2022

Refactor day 3 puzzles.

22.04.2022

Go back to day 1 and improve it even more

21.04.2022

Tests added.
Duiring the optimization I have to check that refactored solution actually give correct result,
so instead of manual work I prefer to semi-automate that process.

20.04.2022

Improve my solution for day 2.

19.04.2022

Improve my solution for day 1. I thought it was good, but ot was not. Also, add some notes about process of optimizatoin. 

18.04.2022

Before jumping into optimization or my solutions and solving remained puzzles cli was created.
I'm not great with making sweet and pretty cli, so for now it is strange and ugly. I hope it can be improved later.

05.04.2022

Repo created.
Solutions for first 2 days added as is. Looks like I lost my original code
because I remember how I refactor day 1 solution after discovering sliding
window approach in [this article](https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2021/12/advent-of-code-2021-in-kotlin-day-1/).

By time of beginning I already know the fact you have to write expandable solutions 
because part 2 _probably_ will use some of part 1 functionality. 
Later, with mode and mode hard tasks, I give up with it. But first attempts was created with almost
production-ready standards: typing, classes and clear login.
